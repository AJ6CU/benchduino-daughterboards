www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains the documentation for this design. Including: 
- Schematic (pdf format) 
- Pinmapping between the Benchduino pins and the pins on the Microcontroller. 
            to multiple locations on the Benchduino. Please use this pinmapping 
            document along with your favorite pinout diagram to understand which 
            pins could cause
            conflicts.

# Design Files for Daughterboard

This folder includes the design files for the Daughterboard. Some of my earlier designs
will have the files for both Eagle and Kicad. However, more recent designs will only
have Kicad because it is "free" for 4 layer boards that are greater than 100mm x 100mm.

I like Eagle a lot, but given I am not a professional board designer, I cannot
justify the annual subscription fees. 

However, if someone wants to take my Kicad designs and move them to Eagle, I would
welcome including them here.

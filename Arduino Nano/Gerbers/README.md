# Arduino Nano CPU Daughterboard for Benchduino
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains a Zip file with the Gerbers for the CPU Daughterboard for a 
Arduino Nano processor.

An earlier version of this design was produced and found to have an error in that the
5V line was not powered in the case where the Nano was powered by USB and there
was no other power connected to the Benchduino motherboard.

This design is in the process of being sent to the fab and checked out. As of
8/30/2020, it has NOT been validated. Although it *should* work, it is even more
risky than normal.

Once I receive these updated versions and have checked them out, i will update this
README file.

There is absolutely no warranty here. Use this at your own risk!

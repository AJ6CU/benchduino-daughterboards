# Example for ESP32-WROOM Benchduino CPU Daughterboard
 
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains the code example (typically derived from the original 
Hamvention code of the published on the hamradioworkbench site)

*IMPORTANT*
If you are using the Arduino IDE, the ESP32 environment does not yet co-exist
with the S2 boards as of Sept 13, 2020. You need to reconfigure to go from one to the
other.

I have included a screen shot of the build configuration that worked for me.

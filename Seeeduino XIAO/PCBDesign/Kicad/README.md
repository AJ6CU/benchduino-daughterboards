# KiCad files for the Seeeduino Xiao MCU Daughterboard

This directory includes the KiCad files for a design of a Benchduino Daughterboard
(see https://www.hamradioworkbench.com ) for the Seeeduino Xiao.

This directory contains a zip file of a KiCad archive of the project. You should be
able to expand it on your system and open up the project file and start modifying it.

In making this design, my philosophy was to try to make sure most Benchduino Pins were 
connected to appropriate pins if possible.

This means that some pins (e.g. Analog and Digital pins) are both active and map to the 
same physical pin on the Seeeduino Xiao. So don't assume that because you have two pins, 
that they are separate. The Seeeduino Xiao pin guide is your friend to make sure you 
don't use the same pin twice for a different purpose.

Feedback is appreciated!

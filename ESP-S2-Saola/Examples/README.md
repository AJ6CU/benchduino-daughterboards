# Example for ESP-S2-Saola Benchduino CPU Daughterboard
 
 
www.hamradioworkbench.com has designed and sells a general purpose development
board for Microcontrollers. They have provided the designs for both the CPU
Daughterboards as wells as the addon Prototype board.

This directory contains the code example (typically derived from the original 
Hamvention code of the published on the hamradioworkbench site)

*IMPORTANT*
If you are using the Arduino IDE, the S2 boards has not been integrated into the based
ESP32 library as of Sept 13, 2020. This means that you cannot build for ESP32 *AND* S2
from same configuration of the Arduino IDE.

This video does a good job describing how to install the board support packages
on a MAC. There are others for PC's and there are also instructions on the github.

I have also included a screen shot of the build configuration that worked for me.
